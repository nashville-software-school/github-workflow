# Github Workflow Guides

You will be spending the majority of your time at NSS working as a team to solve hard problems together. Git and Github are the tools your team will use to work asynchronously and collaborate.

> ðŸ§¨ You are expected to experiment with, explore, and fail with your code throughout this experience. Conversely, you should never "wing it" with git and Github. Follow the guides here to the letter, and immediately ask for help if you are stuck.

## Getting started with a team

* [Clone existing repository](./START_REMOTE.md) that is provided by the instructors.
* [Starting a new project from scratch](./START_LOCAL.md)  with no existing repository
* [Creating a project board](./PROJECTS.md) to hold issue tickets.
* [Create issue tickets](./TICKETS.md) that define discrete units of work for the team.

## Pull requests

* You are ready for your teammates to [review your code](./PR_CREATE.md)
* You want to [review someone else's code](./PR_TESTING.md)
* [You have updated code in your branch](./PR_UPDATE.md) after creating your pull request
* Your code has been [reviewed and approved](./PR_MERGE.md)

## Working with branches

* [Update your branch after PR is merged](./BRANCH_UPDATE.md)
* [Create a branch](./BRANCH_CREATE.md)
