# Github Workflow Guides

You will be spending the majority of your time at NSS working as a team to solve hard problems together. Git and Github are the tools your team will use to work asynchronously and collaborate.

> ðŸ§¨ You are expected to experiment with, explore, and fail with your code throughout this experience. Conversely, you should never "wing it" with git and Github. Follow the guides here to the letter, and immediately ask for help if you are stuck.
