# Git Branch Naming Conventions

1. **Feature Branches**

    Features describe work to be done that will add new functionality to the project.

   - Prefix: `feature/` or `ft/`
   - Example: `feature/new-login-page`, `ft/shopping-cart`

2. **Bug Fix Branches**

    A bug fix modifies current code and does not introduce new functionality.

   - Prefix: `bugfix/`, `hotfix/`, or `fix/`
   - Example: `bugfix/login-error`, `fix/cart-calculation`

4. **Descriptive Names**

    It is common practice to name the branch with a concise description of the work being done.

   - Example: `feature/user-profile-redesign`, `bugfix/cart-total-calculation`

5. **Naming Conventions**

    There are two common conventions for how to seperate words in a branch name

   - Kebab-case: `feature/new-feature`
   - Snake_case: `feature/new_feature`
