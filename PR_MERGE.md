# Merging Your PR

> **Tip:** Remember that curly braces in commands below should not be typed by you. They indicate that you should place your own value there without curly braces.

Do not merge your PR until it has been officially approved one, or more, teammates. The creator of the PR is the only one who should merge it into `develop`.

1. Click the **Merge pull request** button.
2. Click the **Confirm merge** button.
3. Click the **Delete Branch** button.
4. Broadcast to all your teammates that the `develop` branch has been updated.
5. Pull the latest `develop` branch to your machine.
6. [Delete your local branch](./BRANCH_DELETE.md) that was merged.

Decide on a new feature or bug to work on and follow the process for [starting a new branch](./BRANCH_CREATE.md).
