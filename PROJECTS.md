> **Tip:** Remember that curly braces in commands below should not be typed by you. They indicate that you should place your own value there without curly braces.

Before you start [creating issue tickets](./TICKETS.md) that define the work your team needs to complete for a project, you need to create a project board.

1. Go to the team's Github repository page.
2. Click on the **Projects** tab at the top.
3. At the top of this view, you will see a green **Link a project** button, click on the down arrow on the right of it.
4. Choose **New project** then click on the green button.
5. Choose **Board** from the types on the window that appears.
6. Enter in **{project name} {your team name}** in the _Project name_ input field at the top. For example, if you are working on the Cider Falls project, and you come up with a team name of Titans, you'll enter **Cider Falls Titans**.
7. Click green **Create project** at the bottom.
8. You will be given a board with three columns - To Do, In Progress, and Done. Click the + sign next to Done and create a new column named **Backlog** and then click and drag it to be the first column on the left.
9. Watch the [Setting Up Ticket Weights in Github Project Boards](https://www.loom.com/share/e0125963b10b441aa2aac84797c64cbc?sid=a691cd05-9e6c-47b6-b239-9e62fc7940d0) and follow the instructions.
